Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Real Estate Pricing
Overview
This project aims to analyze the dynamics of house valuation in a dynamic real estate market using advanced data analytics techniques and visualization tools. The goal is to identify and understand the myriad variables that significantly influence house prices, providing actionable insights and recommendations to strategically position properties for better business opportunities.

Problem Statement
In the dynamic landscape of the residential real estate market, determining an optimal and competitive price for a house is a multifaceted challenge. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify and understand the variables that significantly influence house prices.

Situation Overview
The real estate industry is inherently complex, influenced by numerous factors that collectively impact the pricing of residential properties. The dataset comprises diverse parameters such as location, size, amenities, market trends, economic indicators, and historical transaction data.
